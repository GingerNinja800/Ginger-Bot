# Ginger-Bot
Python script I wrote when I was 16 during high school for a gaming community on Discord. Goal of the script was to match new players to more experienced players for tutelage based on their character preferences. Warning; code is awful. Features O(n3) for loops. Data set was consistently small so it didn't matter at the time. 
This entire project feels like a homage to bad programming practices.
Gave me some initial experience using web hosting services like Heroku to host the bot 24/7
